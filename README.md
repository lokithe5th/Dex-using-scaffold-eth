🚩 Challenge 3: Minimum Viable Exchange
This is a completed solution for the DEX: Minimum Viable Exchange Buidl Guidl Challenge. 

This challenge will help you build/understand a simple decentralized exchange, with one token-pair (ERC20 BALLOONS ($BAL) and ETH). This repo is an updated version of the original tutorial and challenge repos before it. Please read the intro for a background on what we are building first!

This branch was heavily based off of this archived feature branch.
