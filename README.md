🚩 BuidlGuidl Challenge 3: Minimum Viable Exchange
This is a completed solution for the DEX: Minimum Viable Exchange Buidl Guidl Challenge. 

This challenge created a simple decentralized exchange, with one token-pair (ERC20 BALLOONS, $BAL, and ETH). This repo is an updated version of the original tutorial and challenge repos before it. 

The smart contracts were created from scratch and can be found in hardhat/contracts

This branch was heavily based off of this archived feature branch in scaffold-eth.
